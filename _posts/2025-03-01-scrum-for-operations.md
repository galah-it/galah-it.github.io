## Training
The Scrum Guide https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html is a great place to start but some of the terminology is bit much. It's a short document because it's a lightweight framework. Scrum seems to work best when it's kept simple and lightweight.

## Adapting Scrum to Operations
Think of your Product as your "enablement platform". So, that includes all of the services you look after and the functions you provide to customers. Think of customer as everyone who uses any of your services and elect someone (possibly multiple) to represent the customer by taking on the Product Owner role. Think of your team members as Developers, delivering value, not necessarily by creating software.


I think I'd approach it in this order. I'd probably start introducing standups and retrospectives without necessarily saying that you're doing Scrum.

## 1. Daily Standups
  - Get some sort of board organised that shows all current tickets, who's working on them, and their status (ready, in progress, blocked, done)
  - Refer to tickets on your board to make work visible. Be strict about all work being recorded on the board.
  - Tasks get moved to done status during the daily standup (rather than invisibly during the day). This adds a validation step. Everyone needs to agree that a task is complete. Later you might come up with a formal "Definition of Done". It also keeps focus on task completion, and team members get a little kick out of completing tasks.
  - Limit the standup to 15 minutes total! (that will be a challenge with a large team)
  - Avoid making the daily standup a status update
  - Each person takes their turn to talk about what they're doing today and anything that's blocking them
  - Avoid focussing on what you did yesterday (some people like to talk a lot to appear busy)
  - The focus should be about removing blockers and team members helping each other out
  - Challenges:
    - Some people get nervous about speaking and forget to listen to what others are saying
    - 15 minutes is an intentionally very short time.
    - The Scrum Master needs to stop people waffling. Detailed/technical discussions need to happen after the standup.

## 2. Retrospectives every couple of weeks
  - Interactive session where every team member has an opportunity to say:
    - What went well, what went badly, how things could be improved
    - What we should start, stop, and continue doing
  - It's an opportunity for the team to get together to think about how things can be improved
  - Focus on continuous improvement
    - Make action items/tickets for tasks that come out of retros
    - Build tools to solve repetitive problems
    - Automate processes where human intervention only adds delay
  - To get honest opinions, it's important to design retrospective activities to avoid groupthink. Eg. Make sure people can't see each other's responses before they've had a chance to respond. Examples: https://www.atlassian.com/blog/jira-software/5-fun-sprint-retrospective-ideas-templates
  - Also much harder: It's important that there is psychological safety: everyone is comfortable to take risks, speak up, raise concerns without negative repercussions.
  - Celebrate failure as an opportunity to learn/improve

## 3. Sprint Planning
Once people are comfortable with those events, I'd introduce sprint planning. This has the potential to get time consuming, so I'd start with a light touch.

  - Start with a list of tasks (ordered by priority) that need to be completed. That's called the Product Backlog. Your coordinators should constantly curate that list before the Sprint Planning event.
  - Start with 2 week sprints. Can be changed later.
  - Select the tickets that can realistically be completed within the sprint. That becomes the Sprint Backlog.
  - The team decides on a sprint goal - the thing you want to achieve within the next two weeks. This can be a challenge for ops teams because they're not building a product. Keep it simple rather than re-stating the contents of the tickets.
  - Leave some predefined capacity for unplanned/urgent tasks.
  - The team decides if tickets make sense, are ready to be worked on, have enough info to begin, etc before committing them to the sprint.
  - Ticket completion is the focus, so split tickets if they wont get competed in 1 sprint.
  - Once the work in the sprint is agreed, do not add tickets that would compromise the sprint goal.
  - Reduce Work in Progress (WIP). Team members only work on ONE thing at a time. If they get stuck, they ask for help.
  - Don't assign tickets to people. They pull work in when they have capacity (from the Sprint Backlog by marking a ticket as "in progress").
  - Avoid estimating "Story Points" at this stage. It's time consuming and of limited value.
