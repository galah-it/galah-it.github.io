DevOps is a set of practices, tools, and a cultural mindset that brings development (Dev) and operations (Ops) teams together to improve software delivery, infrastructure management, and system reliability. It emphasizes automation, collaboration, and continuous improvement to help businesses deploy applications faster and more efficiently.

Key Principles of DevOps:
- CI/CD (Continuous Integration & Continuous Deployment) – Automating code testing and deployment for faster releases
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) – Managing servers and cloud resources using code (e.g., Terraform, Ansible)
- Monitoring & Observability – Ensuring system reliability with real-time alerts and logging (e.g., Prometheus, ELK)
- Collaboration & Communication – Breaking silos between developers and IT teams to improve workflows
- Security & Compliance (DevSecOps) – Integrating security into the development lifecycle

By implementing DevOps, businesses can reduce downtime, increase efficiency, and deliver high-quality software with confidence.
